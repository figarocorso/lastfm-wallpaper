lastfm-wallpaper
================
Still under development.

The idea of this project was to change automatically the current system wallpaper with updated Last.fm information.
The process is quite easy:
* Get the last.fm information of a given user
* Get the current wallpaper image (it needs: sudo apt-get install gconf-editor)
* Update it
* Set again the wallpaper

Next steps:
* Obtain some settings from a file
* Proper management of generated images
